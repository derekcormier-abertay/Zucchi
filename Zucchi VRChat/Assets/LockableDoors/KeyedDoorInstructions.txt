Unique Keyed Doors

Included in this prefab is an example that uses 6 layers, which allows for 20 unique keys as well as  Master keys.
You can add more unique keys by increasing the amount of layers or triggers/tumblers used, see below for more info.


Think of each lock having a code.  The code consists of a combination of Key Layers.  So Lock 123 will have
three "tumblers", each looking for a specific layer to unlock it.  Only when all the tumblers see the correct key layer will it open.

Each key should have children objects that are active on the key layer corresponding to the "code" they open.  So the key to Door 123
will have Keylayer1, Keylayer2, and Keylayer3 active.

PROGRAMMING DOOR KEY 'CODES'
------------------
To "program" the door, you need to change the layer in the EnterTrigger component of each Tumbler to the correct code. You may want to
name the door with its code so you can easily match up the key.  Set the gameobjects of the corresponding key active.

MAKING MASTER KEYS
------
Set all child objects in the key active to make a master skeleton key that will open all doors.

MAKING LEVEL KEYS
-----------------
You can set a "level master" key to open a subset of doors, say on a level.
For example: Key1234 with objects 1,2,3,and 4 active will open doors with codes 123, 124, 134, 234.

LEVEL DESIGN TIPS
------------
It is possible for a player to use two mismatched keys at once to make a working key.  You can prevent this by selecting your codes carefully,
using local occlusion on keys that don't belong in other levels, or making the key pickup collider larger and the Tumbler colliders smaller such that
two keys cannot touch the lock at the same time.


MINIMIZING KEY LAYERS
-------------------------
Check below to figure out how to use the least number of layers for the amount of
keys in your world.


The amount of unique keys you can have is determined this way:

2-trigger keys

So for 9 user-generated layers, you can have up to 36 unique doors.
For reference, a 2 trigger key:
4 layers - 6 keys (12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34)
5 layers - 10 keys (12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 24, 25, 34, 35, 45)	
6 layers - 15 keys ...etc
7 layers - 21 keys
8 layers - 28 keys
9 layers - 36 keys

If you use a 3-trigger key, you can have this:
5 layers - 10 keys (123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, 345)
6 layers - 20 keys
7 layers - 35 keys
8 layers - 56 keys
9 layers - 84 keys

4-trigger keys:
6 layers - 14 keys
7 layers - 35 keys
8 layers - 70 keys
9 layers - 126 keys
